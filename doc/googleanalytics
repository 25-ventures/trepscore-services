### Google Analytics

Your customers go everywhere; shouldn't your analytics? Google Analytics shows you the full customer
picture across ads and videos, websites and social tools, tablets and smartphones. That makes it
easier to serve your current customers and win new ones.

### Install Notes

If you are on this page you have already connected to Google Analytics using OAuth. Now please enter
the name of the account and the profile under that account for which you want statistics.

If you go to the Home section in your Google Analytics account, the account is usually near the top,
and then underneath it are profiles, such as "All Web Site Data".

Each week we see how many sessions, users, new users, and page views have occurred on in this
account and profile, as well as the bounce rate, percentage of new sessions and average session
duration. We use different terminology for these within our application, and the data mapping is
like so:

 * **TrepScore Name = Google Name**
 * Total Visits = Sessions
 * Unique Visits = Users
 * New Visits = New Users
 * Percent New Visits = Percent New Sessions
 * Bounce Rate = Bounce Rate
 * Average Visit Duration = Average Session Duration
 * Page Views = Pageviews

### Install Notes

If you are on this page you have already connected to Google Analytics using OAuth. 

Now please point us to the Analytics account that you’d like to monitor on TrepScore.  For this we need two pieces 
of information: the Name of the Account and the Profile under that Account for which you want statistics.

Here’s where you can find that information in Google Analytics:

1. Go to the Home page of your Google Analytics account.
2. In the middle of the Home page you’ll see a table with information such as ‘Sessions’ and ‘Avg. Session Duration’ and ‘Bounce Rate’
3. On the left side of that table you’ll see the Name of your Account.
4. The top line, which is often the name of your company, is the Name of the Account.
5. The bottom line, which is often ‘All Web Site Data’, is your Profile under that Account.  
6. Enter these two pieces of information into the fields below.

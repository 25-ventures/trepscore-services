### Basecamp

Basecamp makes it easy for people in different roles with different responsibilities to communicate and work together. Itâ€™s a place to share files, have discussions, collaborate on documents, assign tasks, and check due dates. Basecamp stores everything securely and can be accessed at anytime from anywhere.
